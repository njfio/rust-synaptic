# Outstanding Issues and Required Fixes

This document lists known gaps in the current implementation of **Synaptic** and
serves as a guide for future development work.  Where applicable it also notes
places where placeholder or simulated behaviour exists.

## Missing or Incomplete Functionality

1. **Database Storage Backend (`src/integrations/database.rs`):**
   - Methods such as `search`, `update`, `delete`, `list_keys`, `count`, `clear`,
     `exists`, `backup`, and `restore` currently return configuration errors
     indicating that these features are not implemented.  Real database
     operations should replace these stubs.
2. **Document Processing (`src/multimodal/document.rs`):**
   - `extract_pdf_text` and `extract_docx_text` contain placeholder
     implementations that simply return fixed messages.  Proper text extraction
     should be implemented using a PDF and DOCX parsing library.
3. **Cross‑Platform Adapter (`src/phase5_basic.rs`):**
   - The `BasicMemoryAdapter` simulates storage operations by returning success
     without actually modifying the internal state.  Real persistence or an
     interior mutable store is needed.
4. **Security Modules:**
   - Several functions accept a `SecurityContext` parameter but do not use it.
     Implement full cryptographic logic for encryption, key management, and
     zero‑knowledge proofs.
5. **Analytics and Temporal Modules:**
   - Many structures accumulate metrics that are never read or updated.
     Additional logic is required to collect statistics and leverage them for
     analysis and insights.
6. **README Cleanup:**
   - The `README.md` contains overly promotional language and outdated claims.
     Revise it to clearly describe the project's goals and current
     functionality in a concise, professional tone.

## Mocking

No production modules use mocking frameworks or fake implementations outside the
above placeholders.  Unit tests are gated behind `#[cfg(test)]` and do not leak
into the compiled library.  No further action is necessary to remove mocking from
production code, but the placeholder implementations above should eventually be
replaced with real functionality.
