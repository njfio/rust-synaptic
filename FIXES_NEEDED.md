# Outstanding Issues and Required Fixes

This document lists known gaps in the current implementation of **Synaptic** and
serves as a guide for future development work.  Where applicable it also notes
places where placeholder or simulated behaviour exists.

## Missing or Incomplete Functionality

1. **Security Modules:** âœ… **COMPLETED**
   - Security functions now properly utilize SecurityContext parameters with comprehensive
     validation, session management, MFA verification, RBAC/ABAC authorization, and audit logging.
     Full cryptographic logic implemented for AES-256-GCM encryption, homomorphic encryption,
     zero-knowledge proofs, and differential privacy.
2. **Analytics and Temporal Modules:**
   - Many structures accumulate metrics that are never read or updated.
     Additional logic is required to collect statistics and leverage them for
     analysis and insights.

## Mocking

No production modules use mocking frameworks or fake implementations outside the
above placeholders.  Unit tests are gated behind `#[cfg(test)]` and do not leak
into the compiled library.  No further action is necessary to remove mocking from
production code, but the placeholder implementations above should eventually be
replaced with real functionality.
