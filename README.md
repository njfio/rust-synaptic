## Quick Start

### Installation

Add Synaptic to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
synaptic = "0.1.0"
```

### Basic Usage

```rust
use synaptic::{AgentMemory, MemoryConfig, MemoryEntry, MemoryType};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create memory system with basic configuration
    let config = MemoryConfig::default();
    let mut memory = AgentMemory::new(config).await?;

    // Store a memory entry
    let entry = MemoryEntry::new(
        "project_alpha".to_string(),
        "AI project using machine learning for data analysis".to_string(),
        MemoryType::LongTerm
    );
    memory.store("project_alpha", entry).await?;

    // Retrieve the memory
    let retrieved = memory.retrieve("project_alpha").await?;
    println!("Retrieved: {:?}", retrieved);

    // Search for related memories
    let results = memory.search("machine learning", 5).await?;
    println!("Found {} related memories", results.len());

    Ok(())
}
```
