- ✅ Comprehensive docker-compose.yml with full service stack:
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Redis cache
  - Kafka + Zookeeper message broker
  - Prometheus metrics collection
  - Grafana visualization dashboards
  - Jaeger distributed tracing
- ✅ Prometheus configuration for metrics scraping
- ✅ Grafana datasource provisioning
- ✅ .dockerignore for optimal image builds

#### 4. Observability & Health Checks
- ✅ Exported observability module in lib.rs
- ✅ Health check system already implemented (circuit breakers, dependency monitoring)
- ✅ Production-ready monitoring infrastructure

#### 5. Project Quality Files
- ✅ **SECURITY.md** - Vulnerability reporting policy and security best practices
- ✅ **.editorconfig** - Consistent code style across all editors
- ✅ **GitHub Issue Templates** - Bug reports and feature requests

- ✅ Added utility commands (install-hooks, dev, watch, bench)
- ✅ Comprehensive help text with all available commands
- ✅ Convenience aliases (test, lint, format)
- ✅ Complete .PHONY declarations

#### 2. Pre-Commit Hooks
- ✅ Created `scripts/pre-commit.sh`
- ✅ Automatic code formatting checks (cargo fmt)
- ✅ Clippy lint enforcement
- ✅ Critical test execution before commit
- ✅ Prevents low-quality commits from entering the codebase

#### 3. Comprehensive Documentation
- ✅ **QUICKSTART.md** - 5-minute getting started guide
  - Installation options
  - First application example
  - Common patterns
  - Feature exploration
  - Troubleshooting
- ✅ **scripts/README.md** - Complete script documentation
  - Usage examples
  - Script guidelines
  - Color code reference

## 🧪 Testing

### Validation Performed

- ✅ Test script functionality verified (`./scripts/run_tests.sh --help`)
- ✅ Makefile targets tested (`make help`)
- ✅ Docker files validated (syntax and structure)
- ✅ Documentation reviewed for accuracy
- ✅ All files follow project conventions

### Test Script Features
```bash
# Priority-based execution
./scripts/run_tests.sh critical  # Core, integration, security
./scripts/run_tests.sh high      # Performance, lifecycle
./scripts/run_tests.sh medium    # Temporal, analytics, search
./scripts/run_tests.sh low       # Logging, visualization, sync
./scripts/run_tests.sh all       # All 161 tests
```

## 💻 Usage Examples

### Quick Development Workflow
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
make install-hooks
