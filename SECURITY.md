# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Synaptic team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **me@njf.io**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

After you submit a report:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

2. **Investigation**: Our security team will investigate the issue and determine its impact and severity.

3. **Status Updates**: We'll keep you informed about our progress throughout the process.

4. **Resolution**: We'll work on a fix and coordinate a release timeline with you.

5. **Credit**: With your permission, we'll publicly credit you for the responsible disclosure.

### Security Update Process

1. The reported vulnerability is confirmed
2. A fix is developed and tested
3. A new release is prepared with the security fix
4. A security advisory is published
5. The fix is released publicly

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Deployment Security

1. **Always use TLS/SSL** in production deployments
2. **Rotate credentials regularly** for database and external services
3. **Enable audit logging** to track access and modifications
4. **Use strong encryption** for sensitive data at rest
5. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse

### Configuration Security

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** or secret management systems
3. **Restrict database access** to necessary services only
4. **Enable firewall rules** to limit network exposure
5. **Keep dependencies updated** to patch known vulnerabilities

### Access Control

1. **Implement proper authentication** for all API endpoints
2. **Use role-based access control (RBAC)** where appropriate
3. **Log security events** for audit purposes
4. **Implement session management** with proper timeouts
5. **Validate all inputs** to prevent injection attacks

## Known Security Considerations

### Experimental Features

The following features are **experimental** and should **NOT** be used in production for security-critical applications:

- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Minimal implementation, experimental only
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Basic stubs, not functional
- **WebAssembly Support**: Requires comprehensive security audit

### Dependencies

We actively monitor our dependencies for security vulnerabilities using:

- `cargo-audit` in CI/CD pipeline
- `cargo-deny` for license and advisory checking
- Automated Dependabot updates

### Rust Security

This project uses Rust's memory safety guarantees and follows these security practices:

- **No unsafe code** (enforced by `forbid(unsafe_code)`)
- **No unwrap() in production** (enforced by clippy)
- **No panic!() in production** (enforced by clippy)
- **Comprehensive error handling** with proper Result types

## Security Hall of Fame

We recognize and thank the following security researchers for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities:
